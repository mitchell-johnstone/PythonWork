# A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects.
# For example, 3124 is one possible permutation
# of the digits 1, 2, 3 and 4. If all of the permutations
# are listed numerically or alphabetically, we
# call it lexicographic order. The lexicographic permutations of 0, 1 and 2 are:
# 012c2a0 c2a0021c2a0 c2a0102c2a0 c2a0120c2a0 c2a0201c2a0 c2a0210
# What is the millionth lexicographic permutation of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9?
