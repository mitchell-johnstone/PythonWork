# Euler's Totient function, φ(n) [sometimes called the phi function], is used to determine
# the number of numbers less than n which are relatively prime to n.
# For example, as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, are all less than nine and relatively prime to nine, φ(9)=6.
#
# n	Relatively Prime	φ(n)	n/φ(n)
# 2	1	1	2
# 3	1,2	2	1.5
# 4	1,3	2	2
# 5	1,2,3,4	4	1.25
# 6	1,5	2	3
# 7	1,2,3,4,5,6	6	1.1666...
# 8	1,3,5,7	4	2
# 9	1,2,4,5,7,8	6	1.5
# 10	1,3,7,9	4	2.5
# It can be seen that n=6 produces a maximum n/φ(n) for n ≤ 10.
#
# Find the value of n ≤ 1,000,000 for which n/φ(n) is a maximum.
