# It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal,
# but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along
# both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.

# If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral
# with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued,
# what is the side length of the square spiral
# for which the ratio of primes along both diagonals first falls below 10%?
