# Euler's Totient function, φ(n) [sometimes called the phi function], is used to determine the number of positive
# numbers less than or equal to n which are relatively prime to n. For example, as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, are all less
# than nine and relatively prime to nine, φ(9)=6.
# The number 1 is considered to be relatively prime to every positive number, so φ(1)=1.
#
# Interestingly, φ(87109)=79180, and it can be seen that 87109 is a permutation of 79180.
#
# Find the value of n, 1 < n < 107, for which φ(n) is a permutation of n and the ratio n/φ(n)
# produces a minimum.

# The general formula to compute φ(n) is the following:
# If the prime factorisation of n is given by n =p1^e1*...*pn^en, then φ(n) = n *(1 - 1/p1)* ... (1 - 1/pn).
